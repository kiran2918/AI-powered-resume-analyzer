schedule/headcount. Safety Plan encompassed the VIP OSBL Project, Butamer ISBL Project, FBS OSBL/ISBL Project, and provisions
for the new H2 plant. Safety Teams for each of these project utilized my plan to help ensure the Safety of all construction crews
Construction: Successfully managed all Outside Battery Limits (OSBL)/ Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) projects, FGS OSBL, Utilities

Accomplishments

2008-2010: Managed Off-Site Battery Limits Projects, which included site clearing for the construction of four new units within the Valero
Benicia Refinery. I was an Operations Supervisor with a vast track record of running safe and successful T/A's for the previous 10 years.
Volunteered to take on a lead role as a team player, to improve my knowledge and experience, and trained for this position, having
managed so may T/A's, squats and previous unit emergencies. Handled very large workloads with success. Previous T/A management with
head counts (200 employees). Effectively managed construction crews of various trades during our VIP Project with head counts of 500
construction employees, supervisors and managers in parallel. Executed work managing supervisors from VLO/Eichleay/Harvest Eng. To
successfully complete the project. Systematically closed out all projects per refinery standard procedures/ turnover packages. The project
began with and included the following
Safety: Standardized our Site Safety Plan. The Safe Plan template was designed to ramp up and down to follow the VIP Project
schedule/headcount. Safety Plan encompassed the VIP OSBL Project, Butamer ISBL Project, FBS OSBL/ISBL Project, and provisions
for the new H2 plant. Safety Teams for each of these project utilized my plan to help ensure the Safety of all construction crews
Construction: Successfully managed all Outside Battery Limits (OSBL)/ Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) projects, FGS OSBL, Utilities
Upgrades, and the H2 unit prep. Volunteered to assume the role of Butamer Mechanical Coordinator (ISBL), as my workload lightened up.
Already heavily involved in the construction phases of all projects, and familiar with the crews coming on board, so it made sense
Successfully managed Union and Non-Union crews on the same jobsite without any mentions of strikes

aircraft makes & customers.
Experience
January 2011
to
Current
Company Name City , State Purchaser / Production Coordinator
My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and
customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.
In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.
I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these
parts as necessary.
When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate
paperwork to purchasing.
Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.
Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more
closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.
Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.
In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed
accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.
Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where
buyers spend more time on parts themselves.
Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.
I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.
If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.
Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.
We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.
Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.
In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an
industry standard to rise above the competition.
Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.
These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.
Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is
key in this position.

Company Name City , State Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist
Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different responsibilities.
Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,
Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.
Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.
After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.
If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.
Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.
I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.
Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.
Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.
All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.
I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,
or items that that have already been received.
As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.
If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.
As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.
This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.
Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being
ordered and used for an Aircraft.
February 2005
to
January 2009
Company Name City , State Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor
I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.
Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.
I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.
This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.
My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.
This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.
I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a
timely fashion.
Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.
I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.
With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.
In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.
This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.
Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.

Current
Company Name City , State Purchaser / Production Coordinator
My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and
customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.
In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.
I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these
parts as necessary.
When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate
paperwork to purchasing.
Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.
Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more
closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.
Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.
In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed
accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.
Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where
buyers spend more time on parts themselves.
Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.
I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.
If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.
Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.
We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.
Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.
In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an
industry standard to rise above the competition.
Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.
These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.
Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is
key in this position.

Company Name City , State Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist
Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different responsibilities.
Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,
Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.
Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.
After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.
If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.
Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.
I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.
Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.
Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.
All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.
I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,
or items that that have already been received.
As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.
If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.
As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.
This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.
Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being
ordered and used for an Aircraft.
February 2005
to
January 2009
Company Name City , State Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor
I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.
Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.
I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.
This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.
My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.
This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.
I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a
timely fashion.
Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.
I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.
With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.
In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.
This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.
Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.

Executive Profile
I am a self-motivated and patient focused nurse executive with a strong history of progressive leadership. I have worked in health care for the past
12 years and in nursing for the past 9. I have been honored to quickly and progressively build upon my experiences to assume key leadership
positions. These opportunities have allowed me to lead the charge on increased facility efficiency and cost savings, while ensuring stellar quality
programming with a focus on infection control, risk management, and quality improvement. Under my direction, organizational improvements in
those areas have flourished while experiencing record surgical volume and implementation of new and innovative procedures. Change under
pressure has been staple in my professional life, and an aspect that has quickly molded me in to a quick-witted yet careful professional; always
putting the patient first, but never losing sight of strategic goals to ensure organizational success.

When you are writing letters, it's important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.
Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.
It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter
doesn't fit well on a page.
Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.
Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.
Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.
It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.
Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your
cover letter.
Here's how to space your cover letter.
When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.
If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar.
Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size.
You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.
How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your
cover letter.
Highlight the content of your letter.
Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.

cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.
Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to
devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.
A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.
Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.
A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.
Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.
There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The
prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance
in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each
position you seek.
Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).
Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences
(remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).
The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.
Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.
Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding

Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS:
Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio
2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,
CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)
LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is
also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project
was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding
additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on
certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.
UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee
id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will
decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception
records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)
Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of
seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can
access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the
main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL
Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two
parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The
existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and
approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to
capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to
validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a
web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an
ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk
data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data
that can be uploaded into each column. AWARDS AND PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION:

Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two
parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The
existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and
approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to
capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to
validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a
web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an
ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk
data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data
that can be uploaded into each column. AWARDS AND PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION:

LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is
also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project
was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding
additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on
certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.

id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will
decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception
records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)

seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can
access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the

Chief Operating Officer 
June 2008 to January 2010 Company Name - City , State
Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.
May 1998 to May 2008 Company Name - City , State
COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.
In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

Professional Experience
Chief Operating Officer 
June 2008 to January 2010 Company Name - City , State
Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.
May 1998 to May 2008 Company Name - City , State
COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.
In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the
OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which
required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components
on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience

improve safety, quality & efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors/ integrators. This role
required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain.
I currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader. This role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so

an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule. I am responsible for developing the skills of 34
mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis. Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to
ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State
Regulatory Laws. Frito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs. My college career at

Summary
I am seeking a position within a Maintenance/Engineering department. I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Technology
with a concentration in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. I feel that I am a great
candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo. Course work for my degree
included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend.
Instrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in
relation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to
use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the
OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which
required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components
on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience
through the Project Engineer & Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent
verbal and written communication skills. While holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to
improve safety, quality & efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors/ integrators. This role
required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain.
I currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader. This role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so
within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget. My team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from
an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule. I am responsible for developing the skills of 34
mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis. Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to

(Fulfillment Operational Data Store).
The LDW ESW is physically located on an MVS/DB2 environment in UK/Portsmouth - UK MVS TSOBA.
There will be no direct access to the LDW ESW system on TSOBA for the common users (key users and LCM have direct access).
Edge-On-Demand is used as a front-end tool with BRIO as the query tool behind.
It's a WEB based solution, which supports different formats (BRIO, HTML, and L123).

It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.
The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on
S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.
The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.
