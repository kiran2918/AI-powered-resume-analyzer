OHCB project is development of a new platform for processing the banking business of HSBC in mainframes Currently this project is in its
SIT phase for Term Deposit and initial design for Lending.
As a part of one HSBC initiative HSBC is Developing new product named OHCB on Mainframes platform which will have all the existing
functionality of it's existing core banking product HUB which is on AS400.
In conjuction with the current functionality of HUB, HSBC has decided to include additional functionality in the OHCB to meet One HSBC
solution.
Currently 53 countries uses HUB as their primary banking system.
OHCB architecture is totally service based so that it remains very loosely coupled and can interact with other OH (One HSBC) financial
product like OH payment, OH forex, OH cards , OHCDM etc easily.
This is the flagship project for HSBC and OHCB will be deployed in all the 85+ countries where HSBC is currently in business by year
2020.

Marketplace Information Warehouse (MIW) is a part of IW suite of applications.
MIW houses multiple sources of data and makes this data easy to use by cleaning, processing, linking, and further defining the data for
faster delivery of information that is critical to the business needs of sales and marketing professionals.
Data is both licensed from external sources and compiled by IBM internally.
MIW receives External data from its Vendors.
MIW refines and process raw information received from different vendors into useful information, which is loaded to DB2 tables.
IBM sales and marketing team access this data using different online interfaces.
The information that MIW receives and process differ for different vendors.

DBA Activities.
Participate in project meeting.
Description: EBI (Enterprise Business Information) Operation includes three batches, one for each GEO (EMEA, NA and AP) running
overnight.
The batches feed daily IDOCs from CBS located on SAP environment to S&D IW located on MVS/DB2 environment through FODS
(Fulfillment Operational Data Store).
The LDW ESW is physically located on an MVS/DB2 environment in UK/Portsmouth - UK MVS TSOBA.
There will be no direct access to the LDW ESW system on TSOBA for the common users (key users and LCM have direct access).
Edge-On-Demand is used as a front-end tool with BRIO as the query tool behind.
It's a WEB based solution, which supports different formats (BRIO, HTML, and L123).
PROJECT: LDS (LEGACY DATA SYSTEMS) Developer Oct 2007 - Mar 2009 Client : IBM, Germany Platform : Z/OS.

DBA Activities.
Participate in project meeting.
Description: The Legacy Data Store (LDS) as a logical part of the EDW consists of 12 tables.
It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.
The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on
S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.
The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

Accomplishments
OHCB project is development of a new platform for processing the banking business of HSBC in mainframes Currently this project is in its
SIT phase for Term Deposit and initial design for Lending.
As a part of one HSBC initiative HSBC is Developing new product named OHCB on Mainframes platform which will have all the existing
functionality of it's existing core banking product HUB which is on AS400.
In conjuction with the current functionality of HUB, HSBC has decided to include additional functionality in the OHCB to meet One HSBC
solution.
Currently 53 countries uses HUB as their primary banking system.
OHCB architecture is totally service based so that it remains very loosely coupled and can interact with other OH (One HSBC) financial
product like OH payment, OH forex, OH cards , OHCDM etc easily.
This is the flagship project for HSBC and OHCB will be deployed in all the 85+ countries where HSBC is currently in business by year
2020.

MIW houses multiple sources of data and makes this data easy to use by cleaning, processing, linking, and further defining the data for
faster delivery of information that is critical to the business needs of sales and marketing professionals.
Data is both licensed from external sources and compiled by IBM internally.
MIW receives External data from its Vendors.
MIW refines and process raw information received from different vendors into useful information, which is loaded to DB2 tables.

Description: EBI (Enterprise Business Information) Operation includes three batches, one for each GEO (EMEA, NA and AP) running
overnight.
The batches feed daily IDOCs from CBS located on SAP environment to S&D IW located on MVS/DB2 environment through FODS
(Fulfillment Operational Data Store).
The LDW ESW is physically located on an MVS/DB2 environment in UK/Portsmouth - UK MVS TSOBA.
There will be no direct access to the LDW ESW system on TSOBA for the common users (key users and LCM have direct access).
Edge-On-Demand is used as a front-end tool with BRIO as the query tool behind.
It's a WEB based solution, which supports different formats (BRIO, HTML, and L123).

Description: The Legacy Data Store (LDS) as a logical part of the EDW consists of 12 tables.
It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.
The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on
S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.
The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

Description: The Legacy Data Store (LDS) as a logical part of the EDW consists of 12 tables.
It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.
The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on
S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.
The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.
